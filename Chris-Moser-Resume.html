  <br><strong>My Big Brazil Reseach Paper <a href="mypaper.pdf - or a link to http://dropbox.com/mypaper">pdf</a></strong><br>
  <em>Collaboration note: I wrote this with the collaboration of all the Supreme Court Justices. Thanks guys!</em><br>
  <br>The choice House Republicans make to replace John Boehner as speaker will say a lot about how the party is going to handle its current identity crisis. Will it finally take governing seriously, or will it go on using its majority in Congress to shut down the government, hold show votes on health care reform, stymie President Obama and try to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president?

The current conventional wisdom holds that the leading candidate is the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Mr. McCarthy, at least, said on Monday that it is time to stop “governing by crisis,” and that he would look for “the most conservative solution I can find.” That might, possibly, hint that he is open to compromise.<br>

  <br><strong>A Model of Strategic Retirement for Supreme Court Justices</strong>
  <br><em>Collaboration note: I wrote this with the collaboration of all the Supreme Court Justices. Thanks guys!</em><br>
  <br>Supreme Court justices nearing the end of their mandate may face conflicting incentives before presidential elections. By retiring early, they can make sure that the current majority will nominate their successor, but have to renounce an often enjoyable and remunerative occupation. Building on a newly collected data set as well as a state-of-the-art dynamic structural choice model, this paper examines the question whether the strategic dimension is a major incentive force in the justices’ retirement decision.<br>
  <br><strong>A Theory of Economics in Brazilian Labor Market and Beaches</strong><br>
  <br>U.S. Special Operations forces have opened a new front in their hunt for the African warlord Joseph Kony, moving closer to his suspected hideout in a lawless enclave straddling Sudan and South Sudan, according to military officials and others familiar with the operation.

As their mission stretches into a fifth year, however, U.S. troops have turned to some unsavory partners to help find Kony’s trail. Working from a new bush camp in the Central African Republic, U.S. forces have begun working closely with Islamist rebels — known as the Seleka — who toppled the central government two years ago and triggered a still-raging sectarian war. The Pentagon has not previously disclosed its intelligence sharing and other forms of cooperation with the Seleka. The arrangement has made some U.S. troops uncomfortable.
